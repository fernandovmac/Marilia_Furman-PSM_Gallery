00:000:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Got to be there, got to be there
In the morning 

2
00:000:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I sometimes see you pass outside my doorWhen she says hello to the world
Got to be there, got to be there
Bring her good times 

3
00:000:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And show her that she's my girl
Oh what a feeling there'll be 

4
00:000:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The moment I know she loves me

5
00:000:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize
I need her sharing her world beside me 

6
00:000:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And you know just what to do

7
00:000:37,500 --> 00:00:43,000
And I want to tell you so much, I love you

8
00:000:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
hello
hello
hello
