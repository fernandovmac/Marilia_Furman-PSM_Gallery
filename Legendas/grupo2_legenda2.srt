1
00:000:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times

2
00:000:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I sometimes see you pass outside my door

3
00:000:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I sometimes see you pass outside my door

4
00:000:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile

5
00:000:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're all I've ever wanted, and my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say

6
00:000:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And you know just what to do

7
00:000:37,500 --> 00:00:43,000
And I want to tell you so much, I love you

8
00:000:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
hello
hello
hello
